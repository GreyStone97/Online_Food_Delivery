## Online_Food_Delivery (<b> :white_check_mark: Update App</b>)

This app allows you to get data on all kinds of dishes from different countries of the world from a free [Edamam API](https://www.edamam.com/).

Next, the process of the application is demonstrated when the user enters the name of the dish, in our case it is pizza and receives 20 recipes with detailed information and the opportunity to see the recipe itself.

### Version 1.0

The version 1.0 is shown below :arrow_heading_down: and reflects the primary design and functionality, and also includes a lack of adaptability.

Also in the next version (version 2.0), not only the color solutions concerning the design of the website were changed, but also the possibility of its adaptability was taken into account not only for various mobile devices, but also for tablets in particular. Since due to the rapid development of technology, you should not lose sight of the moment.

### Version 2.0

In version 2.0, presented below :arrow_heading_down:, you can see that the design has changed from monochrome to gradient using a background image, which added color to the design of the site.

The design of the dish block itself has also changed: the image has expanded slightly, the button for viewing the recipe itself has changed its location and is located at the end of the block, information about the dish has become more concise, and icons of social networks have been added, which significantly allows you to interact with other resources. And for the user, this step allows you to share an interesting recipe in any of the proposed social networks.
